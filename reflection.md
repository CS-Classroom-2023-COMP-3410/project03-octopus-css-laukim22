This was an interesting project.
Some challenges/reflections:
I struggled to get ChatGPT to see the image. It told me then that it could not view the image exactly,
so I reverted to describing to the best of my ability the image. 

I also ran into difficulty when I ran out of chatgpt 4o and could no longer upload attachments such as the 
screenshot and my code. I then switched to Claude, which mostly did well but I also ran out of credits.

I feel that it is very difficult to go slowly and manually through the code due to time constraints and 
I could not get it to the quality that it is with ChatGPT since I am a first time user of html-- again, with the time constraints. I found this very frustrating however, because some things the AI would not fix, small things that I would request of it but did not know how to do on my own.
Overall, claude seemed to do well because it could actually view the image, and from there I made multiple requests for tweaking.
